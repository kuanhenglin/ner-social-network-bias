# Applying Social Network Extraction With Named Entity Recognition to the Examination of Political Bias Within Online News Articles

This Github repository contains all statistical analyses and results for the study "Applying Social Network Extraction With Named Entity Recognition to the Examination of Political Bias Within Online News Articles" by Kuan Heng Lin and Chih Ming Tsai. The paper was accepted to *Proceedings of the 2020 3rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Pattern Recognition (AIPR 2020)*.

For some strange reason, ACM uploaded the **wrong** paper onto their [website](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3430199.3430219), so I have uploaded a PDF copy of my paper onto **this GitHub repository**. This probably violates *multiple* copyright laws but I want our paper to be seen. &nbsp; <sup><sub><sub>ACM please don't sue me.</sub></sub></sup>

*I have been quarrelling with them on this issue for half a year and nothing has changed.*
