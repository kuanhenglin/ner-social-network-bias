Why the link you clicked on led here instead of the ACM website:

For some strange reason, ACM uploaded the **wrong** paper half a year ago and never got around to fixing the issue until very recently, so I uploaded a PDF copy of my paper onto [**this GitHub repository**](https://github.com/kuan-heng-lin/ner-social-network-bias/blob/a19744de6347f99e51e4fe79572312c66cb38865/Kuan%20Heng%20Lin%20and%20Chih%20Ming%20Tsai%20-%20Applying%20Social%20Network%20Extraction%20with%20Named%20Entity%20Recognition%20to%20the%20Examination%20of%20Political%20Bias%20Within%20Online%20News%20Articles.pdf). I will keep this up for another while so links in my old résumés and CVs do not lead to a "404: File not found" error.
